-- An Embedded DSL for Parallel Reductions
--
-- Copyright (C) 2012 Kwanghoon Choi 
--
-- This module offers a very simple DSL allowing one to write a specification
-- of parallel reduction. Each DSL program is compiled by the module to generate
-- a parallelizable function in Haskell. 

-- TODO:
--  * Collaborate with the Monad-Par library
--  * Nice demo examples (Currently, we have only two examples.)
